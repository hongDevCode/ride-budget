Working Prototype Link
You can access the working prototype of the app here: https://hongdevcode.github.io/ride-budget/


### Background:
I live in one of the largest populated city in the U.S. so traffic is always a given, and each day it is a hassale for people who drive and even more for people who do not. Paying attention to local ride share companies trying to break into the local Houston market, I thought to aim this application to find the best ride share provider at any given time. 

### Summary:
This Ride Budget app will help you plan a trip with your local ride share providers to calculate the best estimated price for you base on your location, destination, choice of vehicle, and distance. It also factors in the price changes for any given time.

## Requirements
1. User input of pickup and dropoff location by address, city, or zip code is required
2. User input of type of vehicle by car or suv to required.
3. Once user receives estimated price results, user then clickes on the icon of the desired rideshare provider to be directed to company website to start application. 

### Techinical:

1. I used the Google Maps API show a visual respresentation of the distance and time it would take driving to get from the pickup location to the destination drop off.
2. I used the LYFT API to calculate the cost if the user decides to use the LYFT provider as their desired app.
3. I wrote an algebratic formula with JavaScript and given the GetMe price information to calculate the the price using this ride share provider based on vehicle type, base rate, per mile, per miniute, and safety & security fee.
